## My process

### Built with

- Basic HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was my first challenge here. I had to learn many things even after I thought I was ready to start a challenge. I got more familiar with Github. I learnt more about responsiveness. This project has basically made my mind more open to new challenges in future

<!--To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->

<!-- If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more. -->

### Continued development

I'd like to expand my knowledge on grids and learn some best-practices in HTML, CSS that I don't know yet.
